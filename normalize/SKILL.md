# racecar-normalize

Syncs the eight canonical racecar check scripts into the current project, runs all eight checkers plus `lint-imports`, and reports every finding. Does not fix anything without explicit consent per finding.

## Step 1: locate the project root and identify the shape

`<project_root>` is the directory containing the `Makefile`. Default to `.`.

These files and directories are **always at `<project_root>`**, regardless of shape:

    Makefile
    .venv/
    scripts/
    .gitignore
    .pre-commit-config.yaml
    CHANGELOG.md

The shape determines where the **library pyproject** lives. Identify it from the filesystem before running any checker:

| Shape | Signal | Library pyproject |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| `src` | `pyproject.toml` at root; no `pypkg/`, no `manage.py`, no `djapp/` | `pyproject.toml` |
| `pypkg` | `pypkg/src/pyproject.toml` exists; no `djapp/` | `pypkg/src/pyproject.toml` |
| `pypkg+djapp` | `pypkg/src/pyproject.toml` AND (`djapp/manage.py` or `djapp/pyproject.toml`) | `pypkg/src/pyproject.toml` |
| `djapp` | `pyproject.toml` at root AND (`manage.py` or `djapp/manage.py`) | `pyproject.toml` |

Shape `djapp` has two placements (PACKAGING.md §"Scope"): **nested** (`djapp/manage.py` — source lives in `djapp/`) and **standalone** (`manage.py` at root — the whole repo is the Django project, e.g. an `apps/` + `config/` layout). Note which placement applies; it changes `<src>` below.

All checkers are invoked with `<project_root>` as their root reference (via `--root <project_root>` where the flag exists, or by running from `<project_root>` via the absolute-path convention below). Never `cd` into a subdirectory to run a checker.

## Step 2: sync the check scripts (and missing scaffolding)

Check whether a local racecar checkout is accessible by resolving the symlink at `~/.claude/skills/racecar-normalize` and looking for `scripts/sync_scripts.py` one level up from `normalize/`. If found, use the local sync:

    python3 <racecar_root>/scripts/sync_scripts.py --dest <project_root> --templates

Otherwise fetch remotely:

    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishalapte/racecar/main/scripts/sync_remote.py \
      | python3 - --dest <project_root> --templates

`--templates` additionally delivers any **missing** scaffolding (`Makefile`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.gitignore`, `scripts/install_system_deps.sh`) — create-if-missing only; existing files are never overwritten. A freshly-created Makefile has its shape variables (`SRC`, `PKG`, `DJAPP`, `LIB_PYPROJECT`) unset — set them per the Step 1 shape before running any `make` target, and tell the user you did.

Report the sync output verbatim (created / updated / unchanged / exists per file).

## Step 3: run all eight checkers

Resolve `<scripts>` as `<project_root>/scripts` once. Use absolute paths for every invocation. Never `cd` into a subdirectory -- CWD must not matter.

    python <scripts>/check_upward_imports.py --root <project_root> $(find <project_root>/<src> -name '*.py' -not -path '*/migrations/*')
    python <scripts>/check_cli_commands.py <pkg>          # skip if no __main__.py exists anywhere
    python <scripts>/check_packaging.py --root <project_root>
    python <scripts>/check_dj_model_ref_as_string.py     # Django only: skip if no manage.py
    python <scripts>/check_docs.py
    python <scripts>/check_todo_format.py
    python <scripts>/check_claude_shape.py
    python <scripts>/check_file_placement.py

`<src>` is the source directory from the shape table: `src` for shape `src`, `pypkg/src` for shape `pypkg`/`pypkg+djapp`, `djapp` for nested shape `djapp`. For **standalone** shape `djapp` (`manage.py` at root) there is no single `<src>` directory — enumerate the top-level Python package directories (direct children of `<project_root>` containing `__init__.py` or recognizable Django app/config layout, e.g. `apps/`, `config/`, `common/`) and pass those; never scan `scripts/`, `venv/`, `.venv/`, `migrations/`, or test fixtures.

For `check_dj_model_ref_as_string.py`: if `manage.py shell` fails to start (missing dependency, misconfigured settings), report it as "skipped -- Django shell failed to start" and continue. Do not exit.

## Step 4: run lint-imports

After the eight checkers, attempt to run import-linter:

    lint-imports

Look for the binary at `<project_root>/<venv>/bin/lint-imports`, `<project_root>/.venv/bin/lint-imports`, or bare `lint-imports` on PATH (in that order). Run it from `<project_root>`. If not found, report "skipped -- lint-imports not installed" and continue.

If found but no `[[tool.importlinter.contracts]]` section exists in the library pyproject (location per shape table), report "skipped -- no import-linter contracts configured" and continue.

If found and contracts exist, include the full output in the report. A non-zero exit is a finding, not a fatal error -- continue to the report step.

## Step 5: check pre-commit wiring and system-deps

Check that the git hook is installed:

    test -f .git/hooks/pre-commit

If the file is absent, report it as a gap: "pre-commit hooks not installed -- run `pre-commit install` (or `make install-dev`)." Offer to run `pre-commit install` if the user consents.

Check the system-deps surface:

    test -x <project_root>/scripts/install_system_deps.sh

If absent or not executable, report it as a gap (Step 2 with `--templates` creates it). Also confirm the Makefile has a `system-deps` target wired to that script — `check_packaging.py` flags a missing target, but a target pointing at a nonexistent script is a finding to report here.

## Step 6: report findings

Emit a single consolidated report after all checkers have run. Group by checker. Within each checker, order: Blocker, then Finding, then Warning.

Format:

    ## check_packaging.py
    BLOCKER  pyproject.toml  [build-system].requires  must be ['setuptools>=64']; got ['setuptools>=61.0']
    FINDING  VERSION         deprecated-file           VERSION file is no longer canon; ...
    ...

    ## check_dj_model_ref_as_string.py
    SKIPPED — Django shell failed to start: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'oauth2_provider'

    ## lint-imports
    SKIPPED — no import-linter contracts configured

    ## check_docs.py
    OK — no findings

End with a summary line:

    Blockers: N  |  Findings: N  |  Skipped: N  |  Clean: N  |  lint-imports: passed/failed/skipped

## Step 7: offer to fix

After the report, ask the user which findings to address. Fix only what the user explicitly approves, one finding or checker at a time. Do not batch fixes without per-finding consent.

How to fix the two structural surfaces — reference, not invention:

- **Makefile findings** (missing targets, forbidden tools, `install-dev` gaps): read `<racecar_root>/templates/classic/Makefile` and port the missing target's recipe, adapting only the shape variables (`SRC`, `PKG`, `DJAPP`, `LIB_PYPROJECT`). Propose the diff target-by-target; do not rewrite the whole Makefile, and leave project-specific targets (under `##@` group markers) untouched.
- **pyproject findings** (canon values, missing `[tool.*]` blocks, dev-group drift): the canon values live in `arch-coherence/PACKAGING.md` (§6 dev tools, §7 tool config) and `check_packaging.py`'s output names the expected value per finding. Apply the named value; do not restyle anything the checker did not flag.

Both surfaces are per-project-customized, which is why sync never overwrites them — the fix path is always checker-finding → reference template/canon → minimal approved diff.
