"""SessionStart hook — force-load racecar's cross-cutting baseline into context.

The CLAUDE.md pointer alone is only an instruction; the agent may treat
racecar's README as a routing table to consult later, not as loaded standards
present right now. This hook inlines README.md and every shared/*.md as
`additionalContext` and frames them so the agent recognizes them as already
loaded — not as a preview or table of contents.

Framing rule:
  - Racecar's baseline (README router + shared/*.md) is ALWAYS loaded by
    this hook on every SessionStart.
  - The lens files (arch-coherence/, eng-review/, doc-coherence/,
    llm-summary/) are LOADED ON DEMAND per the README's routing table —
    by design; the README itself says "Do not load component files
    speculatively."
  - The correct answer to "is racecar loaded?" is "yes — baseline is
    present; lenses load when a task selects them."

Wired by sync_claude_md.py on four SessionStart matchers — startup, resume,
clear, compact — so the baseline is re-injected after /clear and after
auto-compaction as well.
