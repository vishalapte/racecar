## Enforcement

Reference this file from your project's `CLAUDE.md` or equivalent agent-instruction file. Read it first to find which component applies. Do not load component files speculatively — read only what the current task requires. If you arrived at a component file directly, return here first.

## Install

From a fresh clone:

    ./install

Bash entrypoint, idempotent. Requires `python3` on `PATH` (stdlib only); the script checks upfront and prints an install hint if it's missing. It does three things, all rooted at this checkout's absolute path:

1. **Symlinks** `~/.claude/skills/racecar`, `racecar-arch-coherence`, `racecar-doc-coherence`, `racecar-eng-review` into the matching directories here, so the `/racecar*` slash commands resolve. An existing symlink pointing somewhere else, or a regular file at one of those paths, is refused — never clobbered.
2. **Pointer block** in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (or `$CLAUDE_MD_PATH`), delimited by `<!-- BEGIN racecar pointer (managed) -->` / `<!-- END racecar pointer (managed) -->` and rewritten in place. Content outside the markers is preserved.
3. **Hooks** in `~/.claude/settings.json` (or `$CLAUDE_SETTINGS_PATH`): a `PreToolUse` Bash hook (`hooks/compound-command-allow.sh`) and a `PostToolUse` Read hook (`hooks/claude_racecar_hook.sh`). The Read hook re-fires the pointer sync whenever the agent reads `racecar/README.md`, so the pointer self-heals if the checkout moves.

Re-run `./install` any time you move the checkout. Nothing else updates per-machine state.

## Bootstrap check

After reading this file: verify that `~/.claude/settings.json` contains a `PostToolUse` hook entry whose `command` path ends with `hooks/claude_racecar_hook.sh`. If it is absent, run `./install`. Do not proceed silently.
