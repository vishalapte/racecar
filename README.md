## Enforcement

Reference this file from your project's `CLAUDE.md` or equivalent agent-instruction file. Read it first to find which component applies. Do not load component files speculatively — read only what the current task requires. If you arrived at a component file directly, return here first.

## Install

From a fresh clone:

    ./install

Bash entrypoint, idempotent. Requires `python3` on `PATH` (stdlib only); the script checks upfront and prints an install hint if it's missing. It does three things, all rooted at this checkout's absolute path:

1. **Symlinks** `~/.claude/skills/racecar`, `racecar-arch-coherence`, `racecar-doc-coherence`, `racecar-eng-review`, `racecar-llm-summary` into the matching directories here, so the `/racecar*` slash commands resolve. An existing symlink pointing somewhere else, or a regular file at one of those paths, is refused — never clobbered.
2. **Pointer block** in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (or `$CLAUDE_MD_PATH`), delimited by `<!-- BEGIN racecar pointer (managed) -->` / `<!-- END racecar pointer (managed) -->` and rewritten in place. Content outside the markers is preserved.
3. **Hooks** in `~/.claude/settings.json` (or `$CLAUDE_SETTINGS_PATH`), four total: a `PreToolUse` Bash hook (`hooks/compound-command-allow.sh`); a `PostToolUse` Read hook (`hooks/claude_racecar_hook.sh`, which re-fires the pointer sync whenever the agent reads `racecar/README.md`, so the pointer self-heals if the checkout moves); and the **decision-log pair** — a `PreCompact` hook (`hooks/precompact_history.py`, matcher `""` = manual + auto) that appends a deterministic compaction marker, and a `SessionStart` hook (`hooks/session_compact_history.py`, matcher `compact`) that prompts the agent to reconcile the log from the transcript after compaction. Both target `<repo>/.claude/HISTORY.md` (found by walking up to `.git`) and mirror to `~/.claude/history/<repo-kebab>.md`; both **no-op unless that project has a `.claude/HISTORY.md`**, so a project opts in simply by creating one.

Re-run `./install` any time you move the checkout. Nothing else updates per-machine state.

**Optional overlay — expert output mode.** `make expert` installs the `racecar-expert-mode` skill (symlink `~/.claude/skills/racecar-expert-mode` → `expert/`) plus a managed pointer block in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` delimited by `<!-- BEGIN racecar-expert-mode pointer (managed) -->` / `<!-- END racecar-expert-mode pointer (managed) -->`. `make expert-uninstall` reverses both. Not run by `./install`; see [`expert/README.md`](expert/README.md).

## Bootstrap check

After reading this file: verify that `~/.claude/settings.json` contains a `PostToolUse` hook entry whose `command` path ends with `hooks/claude_racecar_hook.sh`. If it is absent, run `./install`. Do not proceed silently.
