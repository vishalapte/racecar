# Architectural Coherence — Axioms & Review Lens

Accessed via [`../README.md`](../README.md). If you arrived here directly, read that first.

Apply this lens to verify a system's architectural DAG: imports are acyclic, dependencies flow in a single direction, layers do not leak, peer edges do not form cycles. For Python, `import-linter` mechanizes the properties; this lens is the reviewer-facing version and also checks whether the documented architecture matches what the code actually does.

These axioms assume a single rooted package tree. Multi-root monorepos are not addressed here; guidance will appear when a concrete pattern emerges.

Pair with [eng-review](../eng-review/README.md) for software-engineering hygiene and [doc-coherence](../doc-coherence/README.md) for prose, cross-references, and file naming.

For language-specific coherence, see [PYTHON.md](PYTHON.md) (module structure, imports, CLI, enforcement) and [DJANGO.md](DJANGO.md) (service layer, view layering).

## How to use this file

1. Load this file in full.
2. If `import-linter` is configured, run it first. Any broken contract is a Blocker and supersedes prose reasoning.
3. Apply the **four axioms and their checks**, in order. If an earlier check fails, later checks are moot — fix upstream first.
4. Scan the **architectural red flags**.
5. Group findings by root cause when one defect has many surface occurrences (one cycle can show up as N lazy-import lines).
6. For prose hygiene, file naming, link integrity, or rule testability → [doc-coherence](../doc-coherence/README.md). For code-level hygiene → [eng-review](../eng-review/README.md).
7. If the artifact passes all four checks and trips no red flags, say so in one line and stop.

Do not summarize the artifact. Go straight to issues.

## The axioms and their checks (DAG-ordered)

Everything below derives from one axiom: **the import graph is acyclic.**

### 1. Acyclicity (root axiom)

The import graph must be a DAG. Any cycle — including one papered over by a lazy import — is a Blocker. **This is non-negotiable.**

When `A` imports `B` which imports `A`, the cycle is an architectural bug. At every level — packages, modules, functions — the dependency graph is a DAG. The fix is structural: extract the shared dependency into a third module that both can import, or move the function to the side that already has the import.

Lazy imports (imports inside functions) are the usual symptom — the quickest way to get a circular import to "compile" is to defer it, which hides the real bug. The rules below describe preferred directions that make acyclicity clear at a glance. They are not stricter than the axiom — they are its practical form.

### 2. Direction

Imports flow outward (parent → child) through the package tree or sideways between peers. Business-logic upward imports are forbidden; the environment layer is the only carve-out.

```
fubar/                ← root package
  foo/                ← child of fubar
    alpha/            ← child of foo; leaf package
      data            ← leaf module
  baz/                ← child of fubar; peer of foo
    alpha/
      data
    bravo/
      calculator
```

**Outward / downward (parent → child).** Always allowed. A parent package imports from its subtree. `fubar` imports from `fubar.foo`. This is the default direction.

**Upward (child → parent).** Forbidden for business logic. The environment-layer exception below is the only carve-out.

**Peer-to-peer (sibling → sibling).** Permitted. Check 1's no-cycles rule is the only constraint. Once `foo` imports `baz`, any return edge from `baz` to `foo` creates a cycle and is rejected by check 1 — no separate peer rule is needed.

#### Environment layer exception

Configuration derived from outside the project — environment variables, `.env` files, CLI flags parsed at the top — is an environment layer. It typically lives in the root package's entry file (in Python: `__init__.py` — see [PYTHON.md §1 Module Structure](PYTHON.md#1-module-structure)) or a dedicated `config`/`core` module. Any module in the tree may import from the environment layer; this is semantically equivalent to importing external state. The outward rule applies to business-logic dependencies, not to environment access.

**Constraint on the environment layer.** The environment layer must not import from its children at module load. Read env, compute constants, done. Importing a child during the layer's initialization reintroduces the very circularity the axiom prevents — the child will try to import back to get its configuration, and the layer is not yet fully initialized.

### 3. Layer integrity

The system has a fixed layer order. Dependencies flow downward through the layered graph:

```
Entry points            ← top layer; imports orchestrators and domain
  Orchestrators         ← coordinates; imports domain
    Domain modules      ← business logic; imports utilities
      Pure utilities    ← math, format, I/O helpers; imports external only
```

Nothing in a lower layer imports from a higher one. A utility that needs orchestration logic is misplaced; move it up, don't reach down.

An *orchestrator* is a module that coordinates domain modules to produce a feature-level outcome — for example, a build script that calls compute, database, and export in sequence; a request handler that composes several services; or a CLI entry point that routes to sub-commands. Orchestrators are stateful in the sense that they know which pieces to run in which order; domain modules and utilities are not.

#### Domain boundaries

Packages should be loosely coupled, even where peer imports are allowed. Before adding a peer edge:

- Does the graph stay acyclic? (Check 1 is non-negotiable.)
- Is the direction consistent with existing peer edges at that level?
- Would the shared concept fit better one layer up? If two peers would genuinely need to depend on each other mutually, extract to a common parent or a shared utilities module.

Peer imports work when the provider has no foreknowledge of its consumer — a pure types-or-utilities module (shared enums, coordinates, currency types) is safe to import from anywhere because consumption is just reading; the provider needs nothing from the importer. Peer imports fail when consumption requires mutual foreknowledge — the consumer must know the provider's lifecycle, and the provider must know it is being consumed to cooperate. That is "both peers orchestrating each other," the canonical failure mode.

### 4. Depth-plus-one isolation

Each layer enumerates only its immediate children — never grandchildren. The test: can a grandchild be renamed without touching the grandparent's code or docs?

## Mental models

**Outward-downward dependency.** Imports and references flow parent to child, never upward, never across sibling subtrees. If a child names its parent, the boundary is wrong — the shared concept belongs one layer up, or the child is actually a sibling.

**Peer edges need a pure provider.** Peer imports work when one peer is a types/utilities provider and the others consume. They fail when both peers orchestrate each other.

**Env-layer access is not an upward import.** Reading the environment layer is semantically equivalent to reading external state. The outward rule applies to business logic, not to env access.

**Root causes beat surface counts.** A single architectural defect — one cycle, one upward import, one layer leak — often surfaces as many errors. Report the defect once; list the symptoms as children.

## Red flags — architectural

- Lazy imports (imports inside functions, methods, or conditional blocks) — usually paper over a cycle.
- A utility module that imports a domain or orchestration module.
- Peer packages that mutually orchestrate — extract to a common parent.
- Symbols re-exported up through a parent's `__init__.py` to satisfy an upward importer (the upward importer is the bug).
- Tests that exercise architecture (import reachability) rather than logic.
- `import-linter` contract claims a layer that the code no longer matches.
- A grandchild's internal structure enumerated in a grandparent's CLI listing or doc.
- Environment-layer module that imports from children at load time.

## Decision patterns — architectural

- **Evidence over vibes.** If a cycle is claimed, cite the `import-linter` contract output or the two offending lines.
- **Structural fix over lazy import.** The lazy import is the loan; the structural fix is the repayment. Don't take the loan.
- **Challenge the layer placement.** If a utility needs orchestration logic, the logic is misplaced. If an orchestrator reaches down to a utility that then needs upward access, the utility is misplaced.
- **Roll up before reporting.** One cycle that produces N lazy-import lines is one issue with N occurrences.

## Feedback format

- Group findings by root cause. One root per numbered block; children listed beneath as indented occurrences.
- Each root: `File/Topic — severity — one-sentence description`.
- Severity values are literal: **Blocker / Major / Minor / Nit**. Cycles and upward-import violations default to Blocker; layer slips default to Major; depth-plus-one leaks default to Minor.
- No preamble. Start with root 1.
- End with a single verdict line. Verdict values are literal: **Ship / Revise / Rework**.

Example (shape only — substitute the artifacts under review):

```
1. Root: import cycle fubar.foo ↔ fubar.baz — Blocker — fubar/foo/x.py imports fubar.baz at module load; fubar/baz/y.py imports fubar.foo via lazy import in get_config().
   - fubar/baz/y.py:42 — `from fubar.foo import X` inside get_config().
   - fubar/foo/x.py:7 — `from fubar.baz import Y` at module scope.
2. Root: utility imports orchestration — Major — fubar/utils/date.py imports fubar.billing.invoice. Utilities must not reach upward.
   - fubar/utils/date.py:5 — upward import.
3. fubar/__main__.py — Minor — Root CLI listing enumerates grandchildren of fubar.foo.alpha; depth-plus-one violation.

Verdict: Rework. Root 1 must resolve before anything else; root 2 next; issue 3 on the follow-up.
```
