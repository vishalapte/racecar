"""Enforce arch-coherence/DJANGO.md §2: no cross-module string references in ORM relations.

Reads `[tool.importlinter].root_packages` from the library pyproject (located
via `detect_shape`: `pypkg/src/pyproject.toml` for the pypkg+djapp shape, the
root pyproject for a standalone djapp) and walks each named package. The package
directories are located by globbing the project tree, so a root under `pypkg/src`,
under `djapp/`, or at the repo root is found wherever it lives, never assumed from
the shape. It flags any `ForeignKey`, `OneToOneField`, or `ManyToManyField` call
whose target is a cross-module string literal. Three
forms are exempted because they cross no module boundary and so cannot hide
a cycle:

  - `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` (an attribute access, not a string).
  - `"self"` — required for self-references inside a class body.
  - An unqualified string whose name matches a class defined at module
    top-level in the same file (a forward reference; reorder the classes
    if you want the symbol form, but it is architecturally inert).

Files under any `migrations/` directory are skipped: Django generates them
mechanically and `app_label.model` strings are how migrations serialize
relationships — they are not hand-written architectural choices.

Finding a violation is a purely static AST concern; classifying it needs
Django's `INSTALLED_APPS`. The static walk runs first, and Django is booted
only when there is a violation to classify, so a clean tree never boots:

  - LIVE: the file's containing app is in `INSTALLED_APPS`. Annotated with
    the file's DAG layer (from `[tool.importlinter].contracts` of type
    `layers`) and, where resolvable, the target app's layer plus an UPWARD
    flag if the target sits above the file in the DAG.
  - NOOP: the file's containing app is NOT in `INSTALLED_APPS`. Django will
    not load these models; the violation is dead code, but listed so the
    reader can decide between deletion and registration.
  - UNCLASSIFIED: a violation was found but `INSTALLED_APPS` could not be
    resolved (no `manage.py`, or `manage.py shell` did not boot). The static
    finding stands and is reported; LIVE/NOOP is simply unavailable.

`INSTALLED_APPS` is obtained via `python manage.py shell` (boots Django so
dynamic settings resolve correctly). A boot that does not complete degrades to
the UNCLASSIFIED report rather than failing the gate: the static graph concern
does not hang on the app booting. For tests or constrained environments, set
`STRING_RELATIONS_INSTALLED_APPS` to a comma-separated override list.

String references defeat the import graph: two models can reference each
other without either import appearing, papering over a cycle that the
arch-coherence acyclicity axiom makes a Blocker. The DAG annotation makes
the worst variant — upward layer crossings — explicit.

Usage:
    python scripts/check_dj_model_ref_as_string.py

Exits 0 if clean, 1 if any violation is found, 2 on configuration error.
