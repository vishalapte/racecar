# Django — Architectural Coherence

Accessed via [`README.md`](README.md). If you arrived here directly, read that first.

Django-specific architectural coherence — how the app layers. Django implies Python; for general Python coherence see [`PYTHON.md`](PYTHON.md). For Django engineering hygiene (database/performance, security), see [`../eng-review/DJANGO.md`](../eng-review/DJANGO.md). For the language-agnostic axioms, see [`README.md`](README.md).

Service-layer separation and layered request flow apply the [domain-boundaries](README.md#domain-boundaries) and [layer-integrity](README.md#3-layer-integrity) axioms at the framework level.

This file is intentionally sparse. Standards here are added only when a concrete pattern has emerged in the project; we do not manufacture content ahead of need.

## 1. Module Structure

How Django code is organized. Independent of runtime behavior.

**Service layer.** All business logic resides in `services/<service_name>.py` — not in views, not in models. The app stays a single deployable unit with clear internal module boundaries.

**Models.** Handle data persistence only. No business logic.

**Views.** Handle HTTP request/response only. Use Class-Based Views (CBVs). For access-control mixins on CBVs (`LoginRequiredMixin`, `PermissionRequiredMixin`), see [`../eng-review/DJANGO.md` §2 Security](../eng-review/DJANGO.md#2-security).

## 2. ORM Relations

How models reference each other across modules.

**No cross-module string references in `ForeignKey`, `OneToOneField`, or `ManyToManyField`.** Pass the imported model class — never `'app.Model'` or `'Model'` referring to a model defined in another module. Cross-module string references are the ORM analog of a lazy import: they let two modules reference each other without either import appearing in the graph, papering over a cycle that violates [`README.md` §1 Acyclicity](README.md#1-acyclicity-root-axiom). If you cannot import the target model without a cycle, the relation is the symptom; the cycle is the bug. Fix it structurally — extract the shared concept to a parent module both can import, split the model, or move the FK to the side that already imports the other.

**Exempt forms** (no module boundary crossed, so no cycle can hide):

- **`settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL`** — the swappable user FK. Django resolves it at app-ready time; this is environment-layer access (see [`README.md` Environment layer exception](README.md#environment-layer-exception)), not an inter-module import.
- **`"self"`** — the only way to self-reference inside a class body.
- **Same-file unqualified strings** — `models.ForeignKey("Foo", ...)` where `Foo` is defined later in the same file is a forward reference inside one module. Architecturally inert. Reorder the class definitions if you want the symbol form; the detector ignores these.
- **Files under `migrations/`** — Django generates these mechanically and `app_label.model` strings are how migrations serialize relationships. Not hand-written architectural choices; the detector skips them.

**Detection.** `scripts/check_string_relations.py` enforces this rule across every package listed in `[tool.importlinter].root_packages`. It cross-references Django's `INSTALLED_APPS` (read via `manage.py shell`) and the layered DAG from `[tool.importlinter].contracts`, then reports two sections:

- **LIVE** — file's app is in `INSTALLED_APPS`. Each entry is annotated with the file's DAG layer and, when the target app resolves, the target's layer plus an `UPWARD DAG cross` flag if the target sits above the file. A Blocker.
- **NOOP** — file's app is NOT in `INSTALLED_APPS`. Django will not load these models; the violation is dead code. Decide between deletion and registration.
