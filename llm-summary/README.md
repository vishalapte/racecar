# LLM Summary

The generator (not a review lens): it packages a repo into one shareable Markdown file another person can drag into their own LLM and interview — what the system is, how it works, what entities and endpoints exist — without source access.

Run it with `/racecar-llm-summary`. The bundle lands at `docs/summary/<REPO>.md`.

**When to reach for it:** you want a single file to share with a collaborator, partner, or investor so they can ask their own LLM about the system; or you want to brainstorm refactors from your phone without uploading the repo.

**Not for:** code-writing handoff (that is `CLAUDE.md`), release notes, or reconstruction-grade specs.

## What's here

| Doc | Covers |
|---|---|
| [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) | **Start here.** The bundle spec: the YAML frontmatter schema (entities / relationships / external surface), the discovery procedure, the output contract, the bundle lifecycle, the structural budget. |

The validator is [`scripts/check_brief.py`](scripts/check_brief.py).

Pair with the review lenses under [`../arch-coherence/README.md`](../arch-coherence/README.md), [`../eng-review/README.md`](../eng-review/README.md), and [`../doc-coherence/README.md`](../doc-coherence/README.md). The human storefront is the repo [`../README.md`](../README.md).
