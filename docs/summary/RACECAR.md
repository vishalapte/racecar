entities:
  - name: Lens
    case: none
    lifecycle: realized
    purpose: A review skill that loads one README in full, applies a numbered check list, and emits findings with a verdict.
    notes: "Three ship: racecar-arch-coherence, racecar-doc-coherence, racecar-eng-review."

  - name: Generator
    case: none
    lifecycle: realized
    purpose: A skill that produces an artifact (a Markdown bundle) rather than findings; structurally distinct from a Lens.
    notes: "One ships: racecar-llm-summary. This brief is its output."

  - name: Router
    case: none
    lifecycle: realized
    purpose: The umbrella resolver skill that maps a topic to the component file the agent should load.
    notes: "Loaded only when the user says 'racecar' generically or is unsure which lens applies."

  - name: Overlay
    case: none
    lifecycle: realized
    purpose: A behavioral skill that adjusts agent output discipline without adding any review checks.
    notes: "One ships: racecar-expert-mode. Installed separately via `make expert`, not by `./install`."

  - name: MechanicalCheck
    case: none
    lifecycle: realized
    purpose: A stdlib-only Python script that catches deterministic drift the model is not asked to think about. Most gate (exit 1 on violation); check_face_orchestration and check_config_drift are ADVISORY (exit 0 by default) — gate defects, surface choices.
    notes: "Eleven: check_docs, check_subsystem_docs, check_todo_format, check_file_placement (doc-coherence); check_upward_imports, check_cli_commands, check_dj_model_ref_as_string, check_packaging (arch-coherence, gating); check_face_orchestration (arch-coherence, advisory faces detector); check_brief (llm-summary). All synced to adopters via sync_scripts/init_project EXCEPT check_config_drift (scripts/, racecar-run-only: diffs an adopter's Makefile/pre-commit against templates/classic, needs the racecar checkout)."

  - name: Finding
    case: none
    lifecycle: realized
    purpose: A single review observation tagged with severity (`Blocker`/`Major`/`Minor`/`Nit`) that contributes to a verdict (`Ship`/`Revise`/`Rework`).
    notes: "Not stored on disk. Carried in model context and reproduced in model output per each lens README's Feedback format section. check_packaging reuses a two-tier Blocker/Finding variant in its own output."

  - name: ProjectShape
    case: none
    lifecycle: realized
    purpose: A consumer project's packaging layout — one of `src`, `pypkg`, `pypkg+djapp`, `djapp` — that the packaging canon parameterizes over.
    notes: "Defined in arch-coherence/PACKAGING.md §Scope. Governed by what is on disk — no declared value — and resolved by the same ordered decision in two homes: check_packaging.detect_shape() (Python, for the audit) and templates/classic/racecar.mk (in Make, so the build is self-contained); a coherence test holds them in lockstep. All four share the same infrastructure (PEP 621/735 pyproject, make check gate, dev tool set); only the source layout and pyproject location differ. racecar itself is NOT one of these shapes — it is a standards framework, not a deployable package."

  - name: PointerBlock
    case: on_disk_managed
    lifecycle: realized
    purpose: A managed region inside the user's `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` between BEGIN/END HTML-comment markers that points an agent at this checkout.
    notes: "Two flavors: main pointer (always, by `./install`) and expert pointer (only after `make expert`). Content outside the markers is preserved verbatim on every re-write."

  - name: SkillSymlink
    case: on_disk_managed
    lifecycle: realized
    purpose: A symlink under `~/.claude/skills/` that lets Claude Code resolve a `/racecar*` slash command to a directory inside this checkout.
    notes: "Five created by `./install` (racecar, -arch-coherence, -doc-coherence, -eng-review, -llm-summary); a sixth (racecar-expert-mode) by `make expert`. Refused if a regular file or foreign symlink already occupies the target — never clobbered."

  - name: SettingsHook
    case: on_disk_managed
    lifecycle: realized
    purpose: A `hooks.*` entry in `~/.claude/settings.json` that wires a racecar hook into the Claude Code permission and event pipeline.
    notes: "Seven managed: PreToolUse Bash (compound-command-allow.sh), PostToolUse Read (claude_racecar_hook.sh), PreCompact (precompact_history.py) + SessionStart/compact (session_compact_history.py) [the decision-log pair], and three SessionStart startup/resume/clear/compact hooks — session_load_standards.py (force-load baseline), session_discover_cli.py (CLI-surface snapshot), and session_check_sync.py (warns when this repo's synced check scripts are behind racecar canon). Identified by command basename so a moved checkout self-heals."

  - name: DecisionLog
    case: on_disk_managed
    lifecycle: realized
    purpose: A per-project append-only `<repo>/.claude/HISTORY.md` capturing where context was compacted and the reconciled why; mirrored to `~/.claude/history/<repo-kebab>.md`.
    notes: "Opt-in: the decision-log hooks no-op unless the project already has a `.claude/HISTORY.md`. PreCompact appends a deterministic compaction marker (branch@HEAD, trigger); SessionStart(compact) prompts the agent to mine the pre-compaction transcript and append the rationale. Tiered: deterministic spine + judgment-only why."

  - name: VersionFile
    case: on_disk_managed
    lifecycle: realized
    purpose: A plain `major.minor.patch` text file at the repo root that tracks the framework's release line.
    notes: "Manually edited per shared/COMMITS.md; current 0.10.0. The packaging canon deprecates VERSION only where a `[project].version` exists to replace it; racecar, having no `[project]` table, is exempt and keeps VERSION as its legitimate version home (commit 745cef1)."

  - name: SkillManifest
    case: content_tree
    lifecycle: realized
    purpose: A short YAML-fronted Markdown file (`SKILL.md`) that registers a slash command and points at its sibling README as the loader.
    path_pattern: "<skill>/SKILL.md (root router + arch-coherence, doc-coherence, eng-review, llm-summary, commit, commit-decompose, commit-preflight, doctor, normalize, upgrade, expert)"
    count: 12
    validator: "Claude Code at skill registration time"

  - name: StandardDoc
    case: content_tree
    lifecycle: realized
    purpose: A living Markdown standard — lens README, language overlay, or shared convention — read into the agent's context on demand.
    path_pattern: "<skill>/README.md, arch-coherence/{PYTHON,DJANGO,CLI,PACKAGING,FACES}.md, eng-review/{PYTHON,DJANGO}.md, shared/*.md (incl. DRIFT.md), expert/EXPERT.md, root CLAUDE.md (machine baseline + resolver), root README.md (human storefront)"
    count: "~24"
    validator: "doc-coherence/scripts/check_docs.py (+ check_subsystem_docs.py)"

  - name: ProjectTemplate
    case: content_tree
    lifecycle: realized
    purpose: A copy-into-consumer-project baseline that illustrates the framework's packaging canon. Example artifact, NOT racecar's own operational truth — canon lives in PACKAGING.md + the check scripts.
    path_pattern: "templates/classic/{library-pyproject.toml, djapp-pyproject.toml, Makefile, pre-commit-config.yaml, gitignore, README.md}"
    count: 6
    validator: "arch-coherence/scripts/check_packaging.py (in the consumer project)"
    notes: "Single canonical set (black + isort + pylint). The Django dev group adds two canon tools (PACKAGING.md §6): djhtml (template-tag formatter) and pylint-django (the pylint plugin racecar.mk's lint loads on the djapp). There is no ruff variant (commit 9ad5c27), excluded under the PACKAGING.md governance rule against VC-backed tooling. racecar.mk (identical in every repo, the build half of the Makefile fold) detects the shape from the layout at make-time and sets SRC/PKG/DJAPP/LIB_PYPROJECT/DJAPP_PYPROJECT; its fmt/fmt-check run djhtml and its lint loads --load-plugins=pylint_django, both gated on $(DJAPP)."

# Racecar — Knowledge Package

A Claude Code skills bundle that ships an opinionated Python/Django code-review framework as five installable slash commands plus an optional output-mode overlay. Cloning this repo and running `./install` symlinks its directories into `~/.claude/skills/`, writes a managed pointer block into `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, and registers six Claude Code hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`. After that, the slash commands resolve, the cross-cutting baseline is force-loaded into every session, and the agent reads the lens standards from this checkout on demand.

There is no service, no database, no daemon. Every primitive is a Markdown document loaded into a model's context plus a small set of stdlib Python scripts that mechanize the deterministic checks. The relational sections of this brief — entities, relationships, surface — live in the frontmatter above; the narrative lives below.

## §1. Map

### §1.1 Purpose

Racecar enforces — by review, not by gate — a consistent architectural and engineering discipline for a single owner's Python/Django projects. The framework asserts that **tooling enables design and confirms correctness; responsibility stays with the owner** (`shared/OWNERSHIP.md`). Local checks (`pre-commit`, `lint-imports`, `make check`) replace CI gating because gates decide without the owner in the loop.

Audience is the repo owner. Consumers are Claude Code agents acting under that owner's authority via slash commands. The agent's reading style is set by `shared/PERSONA.md` (precise, no preamble, lead with counterargument) and tightened further by the optional `racecar-expert-mode` overlay.

User-facing primitives:

- **Lens** — a review skill: load one README in full, apply a numbered check list, emit `Finding`s tagged `Blocker / Major / Minor / Nit` with a `Ship / Revise / Rework` verdict. Three lenses ship: `racecar-arch-coherence`, `racecar-doc-coherence`, `racecar-eng-review`.
- **Generator** — a skill that produces an artifact, not a review. One ships: `racecar-llm-summary` (this document is its output).
- **Router** — the umbrella `racecar` skill: a topic-to-component-file resolver. Loaded only when the user says "racecar" generically or is unsure which lens applies.
- **Overlay** — a behavioral skill that adjusts output style without adding checks. One ships: `racecar-expert-mode` (terse, lead-with-result delivery), installed separately via `make expert`.
- **MechanicalCheck** — deterministic Python scripts the lenses delegate to: `check_docs.py`, `check_subsystem_docs.py`, `check_upward_imports.py`, `check_cli_commands.py`, `check_dj_model_ref_as_string.py`, `check_packaging.py`, `check_brief.py`.
- **ProjectShape** — the packaging vocabulary (`src` / `pypkg` / `pypkg+djapp` / `djapp`) the packaging canon (`arch-coherence/PACKAGING.md`) parameterizes a consumer project over.

### §1.2 Modules

| Module | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `arch-coherence/` | Architectural-coherence lens: four checks (acyclicity, direction, layer integrity, depth-plus-one) + Python/Django specifics (`PYTHON.md`, `DJANGO.md`) + the CLI contract (`CLI.md`) + the packaging canon (`PACKAGING.md`) + the faces doctrine (`FACES.md`: `lib → api → faces`, a face is a wrapper on `api`, named-file autodiscovery convention, the single gated `layers` contract, advisory detector) + five enforcement scripts (`check_upward_imports`, `check_cli_commands`, `check_dj_model_ref_as_string`, `check_packaging` gating; `check_face_orchestration` advisory), each with its own test module. |
| `doc-coherence/` | Documentation-coherence lens: update protocol + review lens + four mechanical checks — `check_docs` (link / anchor / §N / vocabulary drift), `check_subsystem_docs` (every import-linter subsystem owns README + CLAUDE), `check_todo_format` (the TODO/PLAN schema), and `check_file_placement` (reference-driven: a doc unreachable from the README/CLAUDE/SKILL resolver seeds, and not under `docs/`, is an orphan). |
| `eng-review/` | Engineering-review wrapper: racecar pre-pass → gstack `/plan-eng-review` → racecar post-pass. |
| `llm-summary/` | This generator's spec + the `check_brief.py` validator. |
| `expert/` | Optional output-mode overlay: terse, high-density expert delivery. |
| `shared/` | Cross-cutting docs loaded on demand: `OPERATIONAL`, `OWNERSHIP`, `VOICE`, `PERSONA`, `GLOSSARY`, `VOCABULARY` (severity/verdict literals), `DRIFT`, `COMMITS`, `TODO_FORMAT`. |
| `scripts/` | racecar-internal tooling (not synced as checks): `sync_claude_md.py` (pointer + hooks), `init_project.py` (scaffolder, incl. `--vertical` and the README skeleton), `sync_scripts.py` (sync canonical checks into an adopter), `check_config_drift.py` (advisory Makefile/pre-commit drift vs templates/classic), `doctor.py`, `expert_mode.py`, `sync_md_to_obsidian.py`. |
| `hooks/` | Claude Code hooks wired into `~/.claude/settings.json`: two bash (`compound-command-allow.sh`, `claude_racecar_hook.sh`) and five Python (`precompact_history.py`, `session_compact_history.py`, `session_load_standards.py`, `session_discover_cli.py`, `session_check_sync.py` — synced-script staleness warning). |
| `templates/` | Copy-into-project starter files under `classic/` (a single canonical set). Example artifacts illustrating the packaging canon — not racecar's own operational truth. |
| `docs/` | Generated briefs from this skill at `docs/summary/<REPO>.md`, including `docs/summary/RACECAR.md` (this file). |
| (root) | `CLAUDE.md` (machine baseline + resolver, force-loaded), `README.md` (human storefront), `SKILL.md` (router), `install`, `Makefile`, `pyproject.toml`, `VERSION`, `LICENSE`. |

### §1.3 Vendors

Pure stdlib at runtime in the shipped scripts. Dev-only dependencies declared in `pyproject.toml` under `[dependency-groups].dev`: `pytest` (test runner), `pyyaml>=6.0` (hard requirement of `check_brief.py`), `black` / `isort` / `pylint` (the canonical consumer toolchain wired into the templates; unused by racecar's own check surface). System dependencies: `python3 ≥ 3.11` for `tomllib` (hard, stdlib only), `jq` (hard for the Bash hook; the Read hook falls back to `sed` if absent), `make` (human surface). Consumer projects additionally need `pip ≥ 25.1` for PEP 735 dependency groups (a template requirement, not racecar's own).

No paid SaaS, no cloud platforms. One sibling skill bundle is referenced by name: **gstack**, a separate Claude Code skill bundle whose `/plan-eng-review` skill `eng-review/README.md` delegates phase 2 to. If gstack is absent the wrapper degrades to pre-pass plus post-pass; the README states the degradation explicitly.

## §2. Implementation

### §2.1 Runtime

Two runtimes share this repo, plus a quasi-runtime that executes in target projects.

1. **Skill bundle (primary).** A set of Markdown documents loaded into a Claude Code agent's context window when the corresponding slash command fires. Entry points are eleven `SKILL.md` files — Claude Code reads YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) to register `/racecar` (router) plus `-arch-coherence`, `-doc-coherence`, `-eng-review`, `-llm-summary`, `-commit`, `-commit-decompose`, `-commit-preflight`, `-doctor`, `-normalize`, and (after `make expert`) `-expert-mode`. The skill body is a one-screen pointer at the relevant `README.md`. The model — not the bundle — does the work. The SessionStart standards-loader hook additionally force-loads the `CLAUDE.md` + `shared/*.md` machine baseline so it is present, not merely routable; `README.md` is the human storefront and is not loaded.

2. **CLI bootstrap (secondary).** A bash entry point (`install`) plus three stdlib Python scripts under `scripts/` (`sync_claude_md.py`, `expert_mode.py`, `sync_md_to_obsidian.py`) that mutate `~/.claude/` state. `make` is the human surface; `./install` is the bash surface. Both end in `scripts/sync_claude_md.py`.

3. **Mechanical pre-pass (quasi-runtime).** The seven scripts under `doc-coherence/scripts/`, `arch-coherence/scripts/`, and `llm-summary/scripts/` run inside the *target* project being reviewed (or, for `check_brief.py`, against any repo with a brief at `docs/<repo>/<REPO>.md`), not inside racecar's own tree. They discover the target via `.git` walk-up and read its `pyproject.toml`.

| Runtime | Entry point | Invocation | State location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Skill: router | `SKILL.md` (root) | `/racecar` | none |
| Skill: arch lens | `arch-coherence/SKILL.md` | `/racecar-arch-coherence` | none |
| Skill: doc lens | `doc-coherence/SKILL.md` | `/racecar-doc-coherence` | none |
| Skill: eng wrapper | `eng-review/SKILL.md` | `/racecar-eng-review` | delegates to gstack |
| Skill: generator | `llm-summary/SKILL.md` | `/racecar-llm-summary` | writes `docs/summary/$REPO.md` in target repo |
| Skill: expert overlay | `expert/SKILL.md` | `/racecar-expert-mode` | session-scoped output behavior |
| Installer | `install` (bash) | `./install` | `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/settings.json` |
| Mechanical pre-pass | `*/scripts/check_*.py` | `make check*` here, or pre-commit / Makefile in target | reads target repo |
| Hook: PreToolUse Bash | `hooks/compound-command-allow.sh` | Claude Code, on every Bash | reads three settings files |
| Hook: PostToolUse Read | `hooks/claude_racecar_hook.sh` | Claude Code, on every Read | re-fires `sync_claude_md.py` on match |
| Hook: PreCompact | `hooks/precompact_history.py` | Claude Code, on compaction | appends marker to project HISTORY.md (opt-in) |
| Hook: SessionStart(compact) | `hooks/session_compact_history.py` | Claude Code, post-compaction | prompts HISTORY.md reconciliation (opt-in) |
| Hook: SessionStart(start/resume/clear/compact) | `hooks/session_load_standards.py` | Claude Code | injects CLAUDE.md + shared/*.md as context |
| Hook: SessionStart(start/resume/clear/compact) | `hooks/session_discover_cli.py` | Claude Code | injects summarized CLI-surface tree |

### §2.2 Entities

See frontmatter `entities` for the class-level enumeration. This section is the narrative gloss.

The system has **no database, no ORM, no `INSTALLED_APPS`** in its own source. The classes split into three flavors.

- **Behavioral primitives** (`case: none`). `Lens`, `Generator`, `Router`, `Overlay`, `MechanicalCheck`, `Finding`, and `ProjectShape` are not stored as files; they are the conceptual vocabulary the framework asserts. A `Lens` is a particular shape of skill (load README, apply checks, emit findings); `Generator` is a contrasting shape (produce an artifact); `Finding` is the unit of lens output; `ProjectShape` is the packaging-layout vocabulary the canon parameterizes a consumer over. The on-disk artifacts realize these classes — each lens skill *is a* `Lens`.

- **Managed on-disk state** (`case: on_disk_managed`). `PointerBlock`, `SkillSymlink`, `SettingsHook`, `DecisionLog`, `VersionFile`. Everything `./install` and `make expert` write or rewrite. The `PointerBlock` and `SettingsHook` are unusual because they live *inside* files the racecar installer does not own — `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `~/.claude/settings.json` — and must coexist with arbitrary other content. The byte-exact BEGIN/END HTML-comment markers and the basename-identity rule on hooks are what make that coexistence safe.

- **Content trees** (`case: content_tree`). `SkillManifest` (six `SKILL.md` files), `StandardDoc` (the Markdown standards corpus: lens READMEs + PYTHON/DJANGO/CLI/PACKAGING overlays + shared/* + expert/EXPERT.md + root README.md), `ProjectTemplate` (five files under `templates/classic/`). The first two are the framework's content; agents read them as standards. `ProjectTemplate` is different in kind: it is an *example* a consumer copies, not a statement of how racecar itself operates — racecar's packaging canon lives in `PACKAGING.md` and the scripts, never in the template files.

### §2.3 Relationships

There are no foreign keys — there is no relational store. The DAG above the frontmatter is logical: skill-manifest → CLAUDE.md (resolver); router → lens (and → generator); lens → mechanical-check (with bidirectional `§N` and docstring citations); installer-script → managed-state; project-template → mechanical-check (via the consumer's `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and `Makefile`); settings-hook → standard-doc and → mechanical-check (the two SessionStart loaders).

The implicit graph between installer scripts, hooks, and consumer artifacts is a star centered on `RACECAR_ROOT`:

```
                            RACECAR_ROOT (git checkout)
                                    |
        +---------------------------+-----------------------------+
        |                           |                             |
    install (bash)         scripts/sync_claude_md.py      scripts/expert_mode.py
        |                           |                             |
        v                           v                             v
~/.claude/skills/{racecar,    ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md          ~/.claude/skills/
 racecar-arch-coherence,        (main pointer block)        racecar-expert-mode
 racecar-doc-coherence,       ~/.claude/settings.json       ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
 racecar-eng-review,            (seven hook entries)            (expert pointer block)
 racecar-llm-summary}                  ^
                                       |  PostToolUse Read self-heal
                                       |  + SessionStart load/discover
                       hooks/{claude_racecar_hook.sh,
                              session_load_standards.py,
                              session_discover_cli.py, ...}
```

Inside the markdown corpus, root `README.md` fans 1→N to each lens README plus 1→1 to `llm-summary/README.md`; each `SKILL.md` points 1→1 to its sibling `README.md`; `arch-coherence/{PYTHON,CLI,PACKAGING}.md`, `doc-coherence/README.md`, and `llm-summary/README.md` each pair bidirectionally with their respective scripts via `§N` backrefs and `__doc__` citations.

### §2.4 External surface

See frontmatter `external_surface` for the full enumeration. Three surface entries warrant body detail because they encode load-bearing behavior the frontmatter cannot convey in one line.

#### §2.4.1 `./install`

Bash, idempotent. Reads three env vars (`CLAUDE_SKILLS_PATH`, `CLAUDE_MD_PATH`, `CLAUDE_SETTINGS_PATH`) with `~/.claude/` defaults. On a fresh clone, the sequence is: `python3` precheck (prints an OS-specific install hint and exits 1 if missing) → for each of five `(skill-name, dir)` pairs, link `~/.claude/skills/<name>` → `<dir>` (refuse on conflict) → invoke `scripts/sync_claude_md.py` to write the pointer block and upsert the seven hooks. A symlink already at the right target is left alone; one pointing elsewhere or a regular file at the path is refused and counted as a conflict (`exit 1`). See `install` and `scripts/sync_claude_md.py` for the symmetry between the bash phase (filesystem primitives) and the Python phase (structured rewriting of CLAUDE.md and settings.json).

#### §2.4.2 PostToolUse Read self-heal

`hooks/claude_racecar_hook.sh` receives PostToolUse JSON on stdin and case-globs `*/racecar/README.md` against `.tool_input.file_path`. On match, it re-fires `sync_claude_md.py` with output silenced. The hook **always exits 0** so a malformed payload never blocks the Read. This is the mechanism by which the pointer block and the absolute paths inside the seven hook entries self-heal whenever the checkout moves.

#### §2.4.3 SessionStart loaders

Two SessionStart hooks, both wired on four matchers (startup, resume, clear, compact) so they re-fire after `/clear` and auto-compaction. `session_load_standards.py` inlines `CLAUDE.md` (racecar's machine baseline, which carries the resolver) and every `shared/*.md` as `additionalContext`, framed so the agent treats the baseline as already present rather than as a routing table to consult later; `README.md` is the human storefront and stays unloaded, and the lens files stay load-on-demand by design. `session_discover_cli.py` finds CLI roots by scanning the filesystem (every direct-child dir of `<repo>/` and `<repo>/src/` with both `__init__.py` and `__main__.py` — deliberately ignoring `[project].name` since dist and import names differ), runs `check_cli_commands.py --json`, then summarizes the enriched tree (dropping kind / pattern codes / audit noise) into context.

Short slash commands, `make` targets, and mechanical pre-pass scripts are fully captured in frontmatter and need no body gloss.

### §2.5 Internal contracts

Cross-module contracts that are not user-callable:

- **Severity vocabulary `Blocker / Major / Minor / Nit`** → canonical home `shared/VOCABULARY.md`; repeated inline in each lens README's `Feedback format` section so a reviewer never has to follow a link. Drift between sibling READMEs is mechanically caught by the vocabulary-identity check in `doc-coherence/scripts/check_docs.py`.
- **Verdict vocabulary `Ship / Revise / Rework`** → same shape as severity; same mechanical identity check.
- **The CLI contract — `commands()` / `subcommands()` / `parser()`** → defined in `arch-coherence/CLI.md`; consumed by every `__main__.py` in a consumer project and by `check_cli_commands.py`. `commands() -> list[tuple[str,str]]` lists direct-child `(name, description)` pairs (Pattern 1/2). `subcommands() -> list[tuple[str,str]]` mirrors each `add_parser(...)` call (required on Pattern 2/3 nodes using `add_subparsers()`, forbidden on Pattern 1). `parser() -> argparse.ArgumentParser` returns the parser without calling `parse_args()` so the audit can walk `parser._actions`. All three are pure data functions; printing is confined to `_print_commands()` (Patterns 1/2) or argparse (Pattern 3).
- **CLI audit JSON (enriched node tree)** → produced by `check_cli_commands.py --json` (schema in `CLI.md §"Audit JSON schema"`); consumed by the `session_discover_cli.py` SessionStart hook, doc generators, and CI. The script enriches (raw audit + resolved `command`/`role`/`description`); each consumer summarizes.
- **Packaging canon (library + djapp pyproject)** → defined in `arch-coherence/PACKAGING.md`; enforced by `check_packaging.py`. The library pyproject carries `[project]` (PEP 621), `[build-system]`, `[dependency-groups].dev` (PEP 735, = the canon tool set), and all `[tool.*]`; the djapp pyproject (Shape `pypkg+djapp` only) carries `[dependency-groups].runtime` and no `[project]`. No VC-backed tool blocks (`[tool.uv|ruff|poetry|pdm]`) are permitted.
- **`[tool.importlinter].root_packages` / `.root_package`** → produced by the consumer's library pyproject; consumed by `check_upward_imports.py` (per owning root) and `check_dj_model_ref_as_string.py`. `check_packaging.detect_shape()` locates the library pyproject for both. Missing → exit 2.
- **`[tool.importlinter].contracts`** (`type='layers'`) → produced by consumer; consumed by `import-linter` (external), `check_dj_model_ref_as_string.py` (UPWARD-DAG-cross annotation), and `check_subsystem_docs.py` (subsystem resolution). Each layer row may be `"A | B"` for independent peers.
- **`[tool.racecar.subsystem-docs]`** → produced by consumer; consumed by `check_subsystem_docs.py`. Keys `loc_threshold` (int, default 1000) and `exclude` (list, added to defaults).
- **`[tool.pylint.MASTER].ignore-paths`** → produced by consumer; consumed by `check_docs.py`. `list[regex]`. Absent → empty tuple.
- **Pointer-block markers / Claude Code hook JSON** → as before: byte-exact BEGIN/END partition of `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` by `sync_claude_md.py` / `expert_mode.py`; hook stdin `{"tool_input": {...}, "cwd": ...}`, PreToolUse may emit `permissionDecision: allow`. Both bash hooks always exit 0 — racecar never denies, only auto-allows or falls through.
- **`racecar-llm-summary` output contract** → produced by `llm-summary/README.md`; consumed by this brief, downstream LLMs, and `check_brief.py` (which also enforces spine/body SHA agreement). Schema drift → `check_brief.py` exit 1.
- **Delivered-file manifest** → `scripts/racecar-manifest.txt`, the single home for the list of files racecar ships to an adopter (entry scripts plus each checker's sibling `_rules/` package modules, Django-only checks tagged). Generated from `sync_scripts.delivered_files` via `--write-manifest`, pinned to the filesystem by a test. Produced by `sync_scripts`; consumed by `sync_remote` (the no-clone GitHub path, which fetches it rather than carrying its own list) and read by the staleness hook. The convention: a checker's `<stem>_rules/` package travels with its entry; nothing per-file is listed twice.

### §2.6 Configuration

Racecar has no production / dev split — there is no deployed instance. Every knob is evaluated on the consumer machine.

- `CLAUDE_SKILLS_PATH` / `CLAUDE_MD_PATH` / `CLAUDE_SETTINGS_PATH` — where `./install` writes skill symlinks / the pointer block / the seven hook entries. Defaults `~/.claude/skills`, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- `STRING_RELATIONS_INSTALLED_APPS` — comma-separated app labels; overrides Django app discovery in `check_dj_model_ref_as_string.py` (test / CI mode; bypasses `manage.py shell`).
- `OBSIDIAN_SYNC_ROOT` — destination root for `scripts/sync_md_to_obsidian.py`. Not wired into the Makefile. CLI flag `--dest` > env var > `dest_root` in `~/.config/obsidian-sync.toml`. No default.
- `--claude-md` / `--target`, `--settings`, `--dry-run` — `sync_claude_md.py` CLI flags. CLI flag > env var > default.
- `VENV` — `Makefile` auto-detect (`.venv`, `venv`, `../venv`); first that exists is prepended to `PATH`.
- **Shape variables in `templates/classic/racecar.mk`**: `SRC` (source root), `PKG` (audited package path), `DJAPP` (Django app dir, empty when not Django), `LIB_PYPROJECT` (library pyproject path), `DJAPP_PYPROJECT` (djapp pyproject path, Shape `pypkg+djapp` only). Set by `racecar.mk`'s make-time shape detection (governed by the layout, not chosen), each with `?=` so the owned `Makefile` can override with an earlier `:=`; `PYTEST_ARGS` appends to `make test`.
- `OBSIDIAN_DEST` / `DATA_DIR` / `OBSIDIAN_SLUG` — racecar's **own** Makefile variables (not in the consumer template); defaults `$(HOME)/Obsidian` / `.data`, slug `<org>-<repo>` from `git remote get-url origin`.
- `[tool.importlinter].root_package(s)` / `.contracts`, `[tool.racecar.subsystem-docs]`, `[tool.pylint.MASTER].ignore-paths` — consumer-project TOML; see §2.5.

No secrets. No environment-variant rows because there is no environment split.

### §2.7 Flows

1. **Fresh install (`./install`).** python3 precheck; for each of five `(skill-name, dir)` pairs, link `~/.claude/skills/<name>` → `<dir>` (refuse on conflict); invoke `scripts/sync_claude_md.py`, which renders the pointer block, partitions `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` on BEGIN/END markers, and upserts the seven hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json` by command basename. Idempotent. Exit 0 if no conflicts; 1 otherwise.

2. **Baseline force-load (SessionStart hook).** On startup / resume / clear / compact, `session_load_standards.py` inlines `CLAUDE.md` + every `shared/*.md` as `additionalContext`, framed as already-loaded; `README.md` (human storefront) stays unloaded and lenses stay load-on-demand. Always non-blocking.

3. **CLI-surface discovery (SessionStart hook).** `session_discover_cli.py` walks up to `.git`, scans for CLI roots (dirs with `__init__.py` + `__main__.py`), runs `check_cli_commands.py --json` under the in-tree `.venv` (or `sys.executable`), summarizes the enriched tree, and injects it.

4. **Pointer self-heal (PostToolUse Read hook).** Reading any `racecar/README.md` re-fires `sync_claude_md.py` silently; hook always exits 0.

5. **Compound-bash autoallow (PreToolUse hook).** `compound-command-allow.sh` reads three settings files, splits the compound on unquoted `&&`/`||`/`;`/`|` via an embedded quote-respecting Python parser, and emits `permissionDecision: allow` only if every subcommand matches an allow prefix and none matches a disallow. Otherwise no output, exit 0 (falls through to the normal prompt — never a deny).

6. **Doc pre-pass (`check_docs.py`).** Walk up to `.git`; check intra-repo links + `#anchor` slugs; check `FILENAME.md §N` citations against the target's heading set. Exit 0/1.

7. **Subsystem-docs pre-pass (`check_subsystem_docs.py`).** Resolve `[tool.importlinter].contracts` packages to dirs; walk for "major" subsystems; assert each owns a non-empty `README.md` + `CLAUDE.md` with a heading. No-op when no contracts. Exit 0/1.

8. **Upward-import check (`check_upward_imports.py`).** Pre-commit feeds file args; the script resolves the owning root for each file (from the shape-located library pyproject's `root_packages`/`root_package`) and rejects `from <owning-root> import …` outside `__init__`/`__main__`. Cross-root imports are left for import-linter. Exit 0/1; 2 on missing config.

9. **CLI-tree audit (`check_cli_commands.py`).** Walk the package tree; verify `commands()`/`subcommands()`/`parser()`; classify Pattern 1/2/3; fan `--help` / no-args / `<sub> --help` probes across a thread pool; capture `__main__` import errors as violations; scan orphans. `--json` emits the enriched tree.

10. **Packaging audit (`check_packaging.py`).** Detect the ProjectShape; validate the library + djapp pyprojects, Makefile targets, `.gitignore`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `CHANGELOG`. Blockers fail; Findings fail only under `--strict`. The VERSION-deprecation Finding fires only where `[project].version` exists. Exit 0/1.

11. **Cross-module string-relation check (`check_dj_model_ref_as_string.py`).** Read `root_packages`; obtain `INSTALLED_APPS`; AST-walk each root; flag string-target ORM relations; classify LIVE/NOOP; annotate UPWARD DAG cross. Self-references and `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` exempt.

12. **Brief generation (`/racecar-llm-summary`).** Read `llm-summary/README.md` in full → discovery walk → draft body → derive frontmatter → write `docs/summary/$REPO.md` → end with `## Confidence` → validate with `check_brief.py`. This brief is the literal artifact of Flow 12 against this repo.

### §2.8 Seams

Plugin / extension surfaces:

- **Skill registration.** Add `<name>/SKILL.md` with `name:`/`description:` frontmatter, add a row to `install`'s symlink loop, add a row to the root resolver `CLAUDE.md`. The pointer block rendered by `sync_claude_md.py:render_block` is intentionally generic and does not enumerate skills.
- **Hook contract.** Append another `upsert_hook(settings, event, matcher, command, basename)` call in `scripts/sync_claude_md.py:sync_settings`. Hooks are identified by command basename so a moved checkout self-heals. Recent examples: the SessionStart baseline-loader (commit `ff21b54`) and the SessionStart CLI-discovery hook (commit `3bb2ec9`).
- **Mechanical check.** A new stdlib script under a lens's `scripts/`; a row in the template `pre-commit-config.yaml` under `repo: local` (or a Makefile `arch`/`docs` target for full-tree audits); and a doc section the docstring backrefs by `§N`. Recent examples: the packaging canon `check_packaging.py` wired into `make arch` + `validate-pyproject` pre-commit (commit `39fb900`), and `check_subsystem_docs.py` (commit `4b67ef5`).
- **Output overlay.** A directory with `SKILL.md` + content `.md`, a manage-block script under `scripts/` using twin BEGIN/END markers, and a `make` install/uninstall target pair. Recent example: `racecar-expert-mode` (commit `6ce3338`).

### §2.9 Design decisions

- **No CI gate; local enforcement only.** `shared/OWNERSHIP.md`: enforcement is `pre-commit` / `lint-imports` / `make check`, not required-status-check workflows. Tooling confirms; the owner ratifies.
- **One packaging opinion, four shapes.** `arch-coherence/PACKAGING.md` (commit `39fb900`). PEP 621/735 pyproject as the sole config source, `Makefile` contract, `.venv` discipline, optional `requirements.txt` via `pip-compile`, the black + isort + pylint dev set. Parameterized over `src` / `pypkg` / `pypkg+djapp` / `djapp`; the canon explicitly does not accommodate uv-shops, Bazel, or other layouts.
- **PSF/PyPA + community OSS governance; no VC-backed tooling.** PACKAGING.md §1–2. `uv`, `ruff`, `poetry`, `pdm` are excluded on governance/lock-in grounds, not technical ones (the reason there is no ruff template variant, commit `9ad5c27`); `check_packaging` blocks `[tool.uv|ruff|poetry|pdm]`.
- **VERSION is deprecated only where `[project].version` can replace it.** Commit `745cef1`. The canon makes `[project].version` the sole version source, but only where a `[project]` table exists. A repo without one (racecar, a docs/scripts/standards framework) keeps `VERSION` as its legitimate version home, and `check_packaging` does not flag it.
- **The §3 CLI surface is a three-contract / three-pattern model.** `arch-coherence/CLI.md` (commit `3bb2ec9`). `commands()`/`subcommands()`/`parser()` are pure data functions; `check_cli_commands.py --json` emits one enriched tree that every consumer (SessionStart hook, doc gen, CI) summarizes — single source of CLI truth.
- **Parallelize the CLI audit.** Commit `98f7738`. Cold `python -m` probes dominated wall time; a structural walk drops `_Probe` sentinels that a thread pool resolves, preserving per-node ordering (so exact-equality tests pass). `__main__` import errors are captured as structural violations rather than killing the audit.
- **Force-load the baseline every SessionStart.** Commit `ff21b54`. The pointer block is only an instruction; inlining the machine baseline (`CLAUDE.md` + `shared/*.md`) as `additionalContext` makes it present, not merely routable. README is the human storefront and is not loaded; lenses stay on-demand by design.
- **Decision log as a tiered hook pair.** Commit `86aee48`. A deterministic `PreCompact` marker (spine) + a `SessionStart(compact)` reconciliation prompt (judgment). Opt-in per project via `.claude/HISTORY.md`.
- **Completion-claim guardrails.** `shared/OPERATIONAL.md` rules 7–12 (commit `9ced60c`): never claim done without the production-path command + exit code; agent-workaround keywords are stop signals; cross-agent equal numbers must be checked; doc invariants need test code; tests routing around production are bugs; banned completion vocabulary.
- **Subsystem-docs presence check.** Commit `4b67ef5`. Every import-linter subsystem must own a README (developer) + CLAUDE (agent); "major" is structural (a subdir) or size (`loc_threshold`).
- **YAML frontmatter as the brief's relational store; class-level entities only.** `llm-summary/README.md`. A downstream LLM queries frontmatter deterministically; field tables blow the line budget and are rarely the interesting query. `check_brief.py` enforces spine/body SHA agreement (commit `938d27c`).
- **Drift doctrine.** `shared/DRIFT.md`. Defense must be structural or automatic; resolve drift at the largest frame that explains the symptom; "duplication is drift" is Tier 1.
- **Faces are a named convention, not a wall.** `arch-coherence/FACES.md`. One library exposed through N thin faces (`lib → api → {cli, mcp, web/django}`); a **face is a wrapper on `api`**. Face→worker routing is advisory, not a hard `forbidden` import-linter contract: walling it would break OWNERSHIP ("tooling confirms, the owner authorizes") and DRIFT ("detect and surface"). The split is **gate genuine defects** (acyclicity + direction are one gated `layers` contract) and **surface choices** (a face reaching past `api` is a finding). The canonical file names (`lib.py`/`api.py`/`mcp.py`/`__main__.py`) are an **autodiscovery contract** (the Django `admin.py` model, fixed because the framework looks them up), not dogma. Role identification is declare-then-verify in three tiers (canonical name → `[tool.racecar.faces]` manifest → structural cut-vertex inference), LLM-last; non-classifiability is itself the drift finding.
- **An advisory detector plus a scaffolder carry the faces convention.** `check_face_orchestration.py` is advisory (exit 0; `--strict` opts in): it identifies each vertical's `lib`/`api`/faces and flags non-classifiable verticals and orchestration restated across faces. `scripts/init_project.py --vertical` scaffolds the canonical `lib → api → cli` vertical (the `startapp` equivalent), so the good shape is the default you receive (FACES.md §10). Scaffold plus advisory detector plus docs-that-teach is how a convention spreads where enforcement does not.
- **djhtml is the canonical Django-template formatter.** `arch-coherence/PACKAGING.md §6`. Idempotent by construction (it only reindents `{% %}` tags), permissively licensed, community OSS — chosen over the heavier, GPL, empirically-idempotent `djlint`. Lives in the Django dev group; `make fmt`/`fmt-check` run it gated on `$(DJAPP)`; `check_packaging` requires it in the django group for any repo with a `manage.py` (the propagation lever to existing Django adopters).
- **pylint-django is the canonical Django lint plugin.** `PACKAGING.md §6`, the second `CANON_DJANGO_TOOLS` entry. It teaches pylint the ORM, so `Model.objects`, the model metaclass, and `on_delete` stop raising false positives. `racecar.mk`'s `lint` loads it on the djapp only (`--load-plugins=pylint_django`), the library tree plain (the library is not Django and may not import it); re-syncing `racecar.mk` propagates it, with no per-repo `[tool.pylint].load-plugins` edit. Motivated by a Django adopter whose djapp lint was red against the plain library config.
- **README is for humans, CLAUDE.md for machines.** README is the readable storefront and is NOT force-loaded into agent context; `CLAUDE.md` is the machine baseline + resolver the SessionStart hook inlines, and the consuming-project pointer references. Modeled on gstack's README/AGENTS/CLAUDE split.
- **Brief home is `docs/summary/<REPO>.md`.** One fixed location, no repo-name path segment (the filename already carries the system identity) and no Sphinx/MkDocs collision heuristic (an implicit detector racecar avoids). User override for the rare exception.
- **Nuanced upgrade, not naive clobber.** The `racecar-upgrade` skill (`upgrade/README.md`) never assumes the existing repo is wrong. Every divergence from current racecar gets a verdict: Conform (drift; bring to base) or Escalate (racecar's default is wrong; change the standard, repo untouched). An intentional-and-right divergence is simply kept with an in-place comment — there is no `[tool.racecar.overrides]` registry (a parallel exception list is a second home for facts the code already states). Burden of proof on Conform; owner-authorized; idempotent. Mechanical floor: `scripts/check_config_drift.py` (portable stdlib Python — deliberately NOT a bash `declare -A` map, which breaks on macOS bash 3.2 — diffing `.pre-commit-config.yaml` against base; Makefile drift is gone as a category under the fold).
- **Makefile fold (owned root + canonical `racecar.mk`).** The build is split: a thin owned `Makefile` (project targets + `include racecar.mk`, never rewritten by racecar) and a canonical `racecar.mk` that is **identical in every repo** (every standard target + the shape logic). `racecar.mk` detects the project shape from what is on disk at make-time (the same ordered decision `check_packaging.detect_shape` makes, written in Make so the build is self-contained) and sets `SRC`/`PKG`/`DJAPP`/`LIB_PYPROJECT` with `?=`, falling back to stock for an unrecognized layout. `make sync` copies it verbatim. Pre-commit hooks that need a shape-computed variable read it through a `print-%` target (`make -s print-LIB_PYPROJECT`), since only Make can resolve it. Nothing per-repo is stored (no shape value, no stamp), so nothing can drift or go stale; restructure the repo and the next `make` reads the new layout. Shape is governed by what is, not by a declared entry. The detection rule lives in exactly two homes (Make and Python `detect_shape`) on purpose, a foundation must know its own shape with only `make` present, and a coherence test holds them in lockstep (PACKAGING.md §7, "Scope").
- **Synced checks are adopter-self-sufficient.** `check_subsystem_docs` and `check_brief` sync to adopters, so an adopter validates its own subsystem docs and its own `docs/summary/` brief without the racecar checkout. `check_brief` needs `pyyaml`, a canonical dev tool (PACKAGING.md §6), so the adopter's gate is self-contained; the template `docs:` target runs `check_brief` guarded so a repo with no brief pays only the inert dependency.
- **Standard README shape as a received template, not a gate.** Human READMEs follow who-what -> Getting Started -> Using -> when/where/why (`templates/classic/README.md`, scaffolded by `init_project`). No checker enforces the section names: forcing headings would be theater. The structure is the easy default you receive, per the FACES.md "make the right thing easy" principle.
- **A heavyweight checker is a thin entry over a rule package only where it earns it.** `check_packaging` (a checklist of ~12 independent audits) is a thin `check_packaging.py` entry over a `check_packaging_rules/` package, one audit per module, composed by a plain `run_all` with no registry. `check_cli_commands` (one cohesive recursive CLI-tree algorithm) stays a single file with one honest `too-many-lines` disable: the same package split would scatter a single algorithm. The rule: decompose a checklist, not a detector; do not split a file to silence a configurable line-count lint.
- **Doc placement is reference-driven; no fixed-taxonomy doc gate.** `check_file_placement` flags a doc only when it is unreachable from the README/CLAUDE/SKILL resolver seeds. There is no gate on a fixed CLAUDE.md section shape: a received doc shape is a default to propose, not to gate, the same reason the faces convention is not walled.
- **The delivered-file list is single-homed in a manifest.** `sync_remote` (the no-clone path) and `sync_scripts` both read one generated, test-pinned `scripts/racecar-manifest.txt`, the single home for the list of files racecar ships to an adopter; a checker's `_rules/` package travels with its entry. Removed canonical scripts are cleaned from adopters on sync.
- **A shared abstraction waits for the second real consumer.** A structural role-map module shared across checkers earns its place only once a second consumer exists; built ahead of need and used by a single detector, it is dead weight. The shared-context abstraction belongs to the moment the second consumer is real, not the first anticipated one.
- **The framework self-lints.** racecar's own scripts pass pylint at 10/10 via a `make lint` step in `make check`; the framework holds itself to the bar it sets for adopters.

### §2.10 Operational

- **Install (fresh clone).** Requires `python3 ≥ 3.11` on `PATH` (stdlib only) and a writable `~/.claude/`. Run `./install`. Idempotent. Override targets via the three env vars.
- **Bootstrap check.** Verify `~/.claude/settings.json` `hooks.PostToolUse` contains an entry whose command ends with `hooks/claude_racecar_hook.sh`. Root `README.md` documents this.
- **Move the checkout.** Re-run `./install`; the PostToolUse Read hook also self-heals the pointer block and the seven hook absolute paths whenever any `racecar/README.md` is read.
- **System dependencies.** `python3 ≥ 3.11` (`tomllib`). Optional `jq` for the Read hook (sed fallback); required `jq` for the Bash hook. `make` for the human surface. Consumer projects additionally need `pip ≥ 25.1` (PEP 735) — a template requirement, not racecar's own.
- **Dev dependencies.** `pip install --group dev` (via `make install-deps`) pulls `black`/`isort`/`pylint`/`pytest`/`pyyaml>=6.0`. Only `pytest` and `pyyaml` exercise racecar's own surface; the formatters/linter are consumer-side defaults.
- **Self-test.** Owner-driven, no `.github/workflows/`. `make check` = `check-docs` + `check-subsystem-docs` + `lint` (pylint over racecar's own scripts, at 10/10) + `pytest` (fifteen modules) + `check-brief`. racecar itself is **not** one of the four ProjectShapes, so `check_packaging` is not run against racecar's own tree.
- **Healthcheck / observability.** None — no service. Hook scripts never block; `sync_claude_md.py` prints `created` / `updated` / `already up to date`.
- **Uninstall.** Not provided for the main install (symlinks + pointer survive a `git rm`). `make expert-uninstall` reverses the overlay.
- **Tests.** Fifteen modules across `arch-coherence/tests`, `doc-coherence/tests`, `llm-summary/tests`, and `scripts/tests` — covering every check script plus `check_face_orchestration`, `init_project`, `doctor`, `sync_claude_md`, and `session_check_sync`. Still untested: `expert_mode.py`, `sync_md_to_obsidian.py`, the two bash hooks, four of the five Python hooks (`session_check_sync.py` is the tested one), and `./install`.

### §2.11 Weirdness

- **The skill spec is the executable artifact.** `llm-summary/README.md` is a Markdown contract a model reads and then *executes by drafting Markdown*. The generator is the model; the spec is the program; `check_brief.py` can only check, never generate. Looks wrong (no source-to-output transformer); is correct (the model is the runtime; Markdown is the source language).
- **The skill describes itself.** This document is `racecar-llm-summary` applied to the repo that contains `racecar-llm-summary`. Not a paradox: the spec changes with the rules; the brief changes with the source.
- **`./install` is bash but ends in a Python script.** Bash does filesystem primitives; Python does structured rewriting (JSON, ordered HTML-comment markers). Each is the right tool for its phase.
- **`compound-command-allow.sh` embeds an inline Python parser.** Splitting `cmd && cmd2 ; cmd3 | cmd4` while respecting quotes is not cleanly expressible in sed/awk. The hook is bash because Claude Code hands it a bash command; the parsing is Python because bash cannot parse bash safely.
- **Mechanical pre-pass scripts run against the *consumer's* repo, not racecar's.** Each walks up to the CWD's `.git`. They ship as skill content and operate on whichever repo the agent is reviewing.
- **racecar is exempt from its own packaging canon.** It has no `[project]` table, no `[tool.importlinter]` block, and is not one of the four ProjectShapes — there is no DAG or wheel to enforce when the artifacts are standalone scripts and Markdown. The framework imposes import-linter and packaging discipline on consumers without claiming to be a deployable package itself; the VERSION carve-out (commit `745cef1`) makes that exemption mechanical rather than asserted.
- **`templates/` is example, not canon.** The template files illustrate the packaging canon for a consumer to copy; they are not authoritative statements about how racecar operates. The truth lives in `PACKAGING.md` + the check scripts. Reading a template as racecar's own config would invert the source of truth.

## §3. Live access

N/A — racecar is a Claude Code skills bundle distributed as a git checkout. There is no deployed instance; the consumer's machine is the only execution environment.

### §3.1 Environments

N/A — no deployed instance.

### §3.2 Auth

N/A — no deployed instance. Filesystem permissions on `~/.claude/` are the only access control.

### §3.3 Operations

N/A — no deployed instance. The CLI surface is enumerated in frontmatter `external_surface.cli_verbs`.

### §3.4 Rate limits

N/A — no deployed instance.

### §3.5 Errors

N/A — no deployed instance. Script exit codes are inlined in frontmatter `external_surface.cli_verbs[].exit` and in §2.7 Flows.

### §3.6 SDKs

N/A — no deployed instance. The install surface is `./install`, `make`, and the slash-command names.

## Confidence

**Least confident**

- §2.2 (Entities): the `ProjectShape` entry treats the four shapes (`src` / `pypkg` / `pypkg+djapp` / `djapp`) as a closed set; if PACKAGING.md grows a fifth shape this brief will lag. Verify against `arch-coherence/PACKAGING.md §Scope` and the `detect_shape` branches in `arch-coherence/scripts/check_packaging.py`.
- §2.1 / §2.4.3 (SessionStart hooks): the claim that both SessionStart loaders fire on exactly the four matchers (startup / resume / clear / compact) is taken from the `upsert_hook` calls in `scripts/sync_claude_md.py`; verify against the `SESSION_*` matcher constants and the `sync_settings` body there.
- §2.5 (Internal contracts): the `subcommands()` / `parser()` "required on Pattern 2/3, forbidden on Pattern 1" rule is transcribed from `arch-coherence/CLI.md §"The three contracts"`; if `_classify` in `check_cli_commands.py` enforces it differently, the script is authoritative. Verify against the current `_classify` / contract-checking code.
- §2.10 / frontmatter (snapshot point): this brief describes the 0.10.0 working tree, which is uncommitted on top of `58996ce` (the frontmatter `sha`, the 0.9.0 base the 0.10.0 work sits on). The 0.10.0 release commit does not exist yet, so the test-module count and `make check` chain are read from the working tree, not a commit. Verify with `make test` and `grep -n 'check:' Makefile`; re-stamp `target.sha` to the release commit after it lands if precision matters.
- §2.9 / §2.2 (Faces): `check_face_orchestration.py`'s Tier-3 structural inference (api = cut vertex between faces and lib) is summarized from the rebuilt script; the exact articulation-point algorithm and the single-face `api==lib` collapse edge are authoritative in `arch-coherence/scripts/check_face_orchestration.py` (`_cut_vertices` / `_infer_api`). Verify there and in `arch-coherence/FACES.md §5`.
