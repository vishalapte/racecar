# racecar — agent baseline (machine)

This file is racecar's machine-facing baseline. It is FORCE-LOADED into every session by the `session_load_standards` hook, together with every `*.md` under `shared/`. The human-facing storefront is [README.md](README.md); README is written for people and is **not** loaded into agent context. This file is, and it can be dense.

racecar is a deterministic code-review framework for Python and Django: written standards plus low-entropy checks the agent runs (stdlib Python scripts, never LLM judgment). When doing AI-assisted work in a project that has applied racecar, obey the standards and run the checks.

## What "loaded" means

- **Baseline (always on).** This file plus `shared/*.md` are injected every SessionStart — operational discipline, persona, drift doctrine, voice, glossary, ownership, commit rules, TODO format. Treat them as present; do not re-Read them.
- **Lenses (on demand).** The files under `arch-coherence/`, `eng-review/`, `doc-coherence/`, `llm-summary/` load only when a task selects them. Read the file the resolver below names when the task matches its topic; do not load lenses speculatively.
- The correct answer to "is racecar loaded?" is "yes — baseline is present; lenses load when a task selects them," evidenced by reproducing the `Load token:` planted in the session preamble.

## Resolver (topic → load)

This is the routing table. Load the file that applies to the task at hand. Do not load all files.

Topic: Packaging & tooling — racecar's single packaging opinion, parameterized over four supported project shapes (`src`, `pypkg`, `pypkg+djapp`, `djapp`): `pyproject.toml` (PEP 517/518/621), `Makefile` contract, virtualenv discipline, optional `requirements.txt` lockfile (validate-if-present, not canon-generated), racecar's dev tool set, PSF/PyPA + community OSS governance (no VC-backed tooling).

## Enforcement

A project applies racecar by referencing this file from its own `CLAUDE.md` or equivalent agent-instruction file (the `./install` pointer block does this automatically; see [README.md](README.md) "Install"). Read this file first to find which component applies. Do not load component files speculatively — read only what the current task requires. If you arrived at a component file directly, return here first.

Enforce mechanically in the consuming repo: run `make arch` / `make check` and the pre-commit hooks. A failing check names a file and line; fix it before proceeding.

## Open work

Current state and the in-flight flight plan live in [TODO.md](TODO.md) (the one index), which resolves to [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).
